# Mollie API
[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/mollie-api.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mollie-api)

This is a wrapper around Mollie's API.
The library is written in TypeScript and has typings available.

# Difference with the official library
This library is promise based and does not try to do some overly cumbersome
parsing on the data returned from the Mollie API.
